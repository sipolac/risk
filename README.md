# risk

This project has some functions for computing the probabilities of battle outcomes in the board game [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)).

A few advantages of this implementation:
* The probabilities are exact (doesn't use a simulator).
* It can compute probabilities for attacks on **multiple territories**!
* It can handle **dice bonuses** (e.g., a player rolling with 8-sided dice). This is helpful if you're playing on [warfish.net](www.warfish.net) or another platform that has user-created maps.
* Allows user to specify when they want to stop attacking. This is useful if they want to guarantee a certain number of troops on the attacking territory after the engagementâ€”maybe to defend against a different adjacent territory.
* Under the hood, it uses dynamic programming, which is probably a bit cleaner than using matrix algebra (e.g., a direct implementation of [this paper](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~jaosborn/research/RISK.pdf)).
* It runs quickly. Even for large inputs (e.g., 100 vs. 100), runtime is less than a second.

I've also included some functions that help with higher-level decision making:
* **Offensive troop allocation** (`min_troops.find_min_troops`): A function that finds the smallest number of troops that would guarantee a win probability that is *at least* some target probability. This is useful for deciding where to allocate troops before an attack.
*  **Defensive troop allocation** (`fortify.fortify`): A function that allocates troops across multiple battle configurations in a way that minimizes the probability of losing *one or more* battles. This is useful when allocating troops to, say, protect the choke points of a continent. (In order to get a continent bonus, you must hold *every* territory of that continent.) Note the battle configurations may themselves be composed of multiple territories.

Code is written in Python 3.7.4.

### Battle outcomes

If you have 5 troops and you're attacking a territory with 3 troops, the probability of overtaking the territory is:

```
>>> python3 battle.py 5 3
territory | attack win probability
        1 | 0.6416228964559516
```

To show the probability of all outcomes (`--all`):

```
>>> python3 battle.py 5 3 --all
territory | attack | defense | probability
        1 |      1 |       1 | 0.08332453584748056

        1 |                   1 |                1 | 1.0

.......................defense (cumulative).......................

        1 |                   3 |                3 | 0.13115845129680434
        1 |                   2 |                2 | 0.27505256769656794
        1 |                   1 |                1 | 0.3583771035440485
        1 |                   0 |                0 | 1.0

territory | attack win probability
        1 | 0.6416228964559516
```

Let's add a few wrinkles:
* Instead of just one territory, you want to attack **three territories consecutively**, moving all your troops onto conquered territories along the way. The second territory has 2 troops, and the third has 1.
* The **second territory** has a +2 defense bonus, meaning defense rolls with **8-sided dice** when defending that territory.

### Troop allocation

If you want to know the minimum number of attack troops that would guarantee victory with at least 0.95 probability in the above scenario, you could do the following:

```
>>> python3 min_troops.py 0.95 3 2 1 --dsides 6 8 6
17 troops gives a win probability of 0.953038445204023
```

<!-- With verbosity (`-v`), you can see the values tested:

```
>>> python3 min_troops.py 0.95 3 2 1 --dsides 6 8 6 -v
2019-08-19 00:12:27,077 - testing upper bound 8...
2019-08-19 00:12:27,129 - not high enough; trying range 9 to 16...
2019-08-19 00:12:27,130 - not high enough; trying range 17 to 32...

2019-08-19 00:12:27,136 - 24 (midpoint of 17 and 32) gives 0.9964873460982187
2019-08-19 00:12:27,139 - 20 (midpoint of 17 and 23) gives 0.9840648899621028
2019-08-19 00:12:27,141 - 18 (midpoint of 17 and 19) gives 0.9670287614740551
2019-08-19 00:12:27,143 - 17 (midpoint of 17 and 17) gives 0.953038445204023
17 troops gives a win probability of 0.953038445204023

### Battle outcomes

Using the scenario from above:

```python
>>> from risk import battle
>>> battle_probs = battle.calc_probs(a=5, d=[3, 2, 1], d_sides=[6, 8, 6])
>>> battle_probs.dist
{Outcome(terr_idx=1, a_troops=1, d_troops=2): 0.38715323159729165, Outcome(terr_idx=1, a_troops=1, d_troops=1): 0.09612780006053091, Outcome(terr_idx=2, a_troops=1, d_troops=1): 0.09326837465921452, Outcome(terr_idx=2, a_troops=2, d_troops=0): 0.03540994291874709, Outcome(terr_idx=2, a_troops=3, d_troops=0): 0.029663547220175827, Outcome(terr_idx=0, a_troops=1, d_troops=1): 0.08332453584748056, Outcome(terr_idx=0, a_troops=1, d_troops=3): 0.13115845129680434, Outcome(terr_idx=0, a_troops=1, d_troops=2): 0.1438941163997636}
```
```python
>>> battle_probs.win  # indexed by territory
[0.64162289645596, 0.15834186479813744, 0.06507349013892291]
```
```python
>>> battle_probs.cumul.attack
[(CumulOutcome(terr_idx=2, troops_total=5, troops=3), 0.029663547220175827), (CumulOutcome(terr_idx=2, troops_total=4, troops=2), 0.06507349013892291), (CumulOutcome(terr_idx=2, troops_total=3, troops=1), 0.15834186479813744), (CumulOutcome(terr_idx=1, troops_total=2, troops=1), 0.64162289645596), (CumulOutcome(terr_idx=0, troops_total=1, troops=1), 1.0000000000000084)]
```
<!-- ```python

>>> printing.print_win_probs(battle_probs)  # one of a few printing functions
territory | attack win probability
        1 | 0.64162289645596
        2 | 0.15834186479813744
        3 | 0.06507349013892291
``` -->


<a name="py_alloc"/>

### Troop allocation

Again, using the scenario above:

```python
>>> from risk import min_troops
>>> min_troops.find_min_troops(0.95, dict(d=[3, 2, 1], d_sides=[6, 8, 6]))
17
```

Now a new scenario (a Python exclusive!): Let's say there are **three choke points** of a continent you're trying to defend, and they have the following configurations:
* The other player has 8 troops against your 4 troops (0.83 probability of getting taken over).
* The other player has 8 troops against your 4 troops, and defense has a +2 bonus (0.54 probability).
* The other player has 16 troops against three consecutive territories, which have 8 troops, 3 troops and 2 troops (0.64 probability).

The probability of the attacking player winning one or more of these engagements is 1 - [(1 - 0.83) * (1 - 0.54) * (1 - 0.64)] = 0.97. If you want to allocate 10 troops to minimize this probability:

```python
>>> from risk import fortify
>>> arg_list = [dict(a=8, d=[4]),
...             dict(a=8, d=[4], d_sides=[8]),
...             dict(a=16, d=[8, 3, 2])]
>>> troops_to_allocate = 10
>>> arg_list_new = fortify.fortify(troops_to_allocate, *arg_list)
>>> for args in arg_list_new:
...     print(args)
... 
{'a': 8, 'd': [9]}
{'a': 8, 'd': [5], 'd_sides': [8]}
{'a': 16, 'd': [8, 4, 5]}
```

This would add 5 troops to the first configuration, 2 to the second, and the remaining 3 to the third. If we compute the probability of attack winning in the three *new* configurations, we get 0.37, 0.28 and 0.43 respectively. Now the probability that attack wins one or more of the engagements is 1 - [(1 - 0.37) * (1 - 0.28) * (1 - 0.43)] = 0.73.
