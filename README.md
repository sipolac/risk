# risk

This project has some functions for computing the probabilities of battle outcomes in the board game [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)).

A few advantages of this implementation:
* The probabilities are exact (doesn't use a simulator).
* It can compute probabilities for attacks on **multiple territories**!
* It can handle **dice bonuses** (e.g., a player rolling with 8-sided dice). This is helpful if you're playing on [warfish.net](www.warfish.net) or another platform that has user-created maps.
* Allows user to specify when they want to stop attacking. This is useful if they want to guarantee a certain number of troops on the attacking territory after the engagementâ€”maybe to defend against a different adjacent territory.
* Under the hood, it uses dynamic programming, which is probably a bit cleaner than using matrix algebra (e.g., a direct implementation of [this paper](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~jaosborn/research/RISK.pdf)).
* It runs quickly. Even for large inputs (e.g., 100 vs. 100), runtime is less than a second.

I've also included a function that helps you find the smallest number of troops that would guarantee a win probability that is *at least* some target probability. This is useful for deciding where to allocate troops at the beginning of a turn.

Code is written in Python 3.7.4.

### Battle outcomes

If you have 5 troops and you're attacking a territory with 3 troops, the probability of overtaking the territory is:

```
>>> python3 battle.py 5 3
territory | attack win probability
        1 | 0.6416228964559516
```

To show all outcome probabilities (`--all`):

```
>>> python3 battle.py 5 3 --all
territory | attack | defense | probability
        1 |      1 |       1 | 0.08332453584748056
        1 |      1 |       2 | 0.1438941163997636

        1 |                   5 |                5 | 0.24518997199359854
        1 |                   4 |                4 | 0.4534162413379672

        1 |                   1 |                1 | 1.0

.......................defense (cumulative).......................
territory | troops on territory | troops remaining | cumulative prob.
        1 |                   3 |                3 | 0.13115845129680434
        1 |                   2 |                2 | 0.27505256769656794
        1 |                   1 |                1 | 0.3583771035440485
        1 |                   0 |                0 | 1.0

territory | attack win probability
        1 | 0.6416228964559516
```

Let's add a few wrinkles:
* Instead of just one territory, you want to attack **three territories consecutively**, moving all your troops onto conquered territories along the way. The second territory has 2 troops, and the third has 1.
* The second of the three territories has a +2 defense bonus, meaning defense rolls with **8-sided dice** when defending that territory.

### Troop allocation

If you want to *find* the minimum number of attack troops that would guarantee victory with at least 0.95 probability in the above scenario, you could do the following:

```
>>> python3 min_troops.py 0.95 3 2 1 --dsides 6 8 6
17 troops gives a win probability of 0.953038445204023
```

With verbosity (`-v`), you can see the values tested:

```
>>> python3 min_troops.py 0.95 3 2 1 --dsides 6 8 6 -v
2019-08-19 00:12:27,077 - testing upper bound 8...
2019-08-19 00:12:27,129 - not high enough; trying range 9 to 16...
2019-08-19 00:12:27,130 - not high enough; trying range 17 to 32...
2019-08-19 00:12:27,134 - searching for number of troops...
2019-08-19 00:12:27,136 - 24 (midpoint of 17 and 32) gives 0.9964873460982187
2019-08-19 00:12:27,139 - 20 (midpoint of 17 and 23) gives 0.9840648899621028
2019-08-19 00:12:27,141 - 18 (midpoint of 17 and 19) gives 0.9670287614740551
2019-08-19 00:12:27,143 - 17 (midpoint of 17 and 17) gives 0.953038445204023
17 troops gives a win probability of 0.953038445204023
