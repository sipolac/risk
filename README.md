# risk

This project has some functions for computing the probabilities of battle outcomes in the board game [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)).

A few advantages of this implementation:
* The probabilities are exact (doesn't use a simulator).
* It runs quickly. Even for large inputs (e.g., 100 vs. 100), runtime is less than a second.
* It can compute probabilities for attacks on **multiple territories**!
* It can handle **dice bonuses** (e.g., a player rolling with 8-sided dice). This is helpful if you're playing on [warfish.net](www.warfish.net) or another platform that has user-created maps.
* Allows user to specify when they want to stop attacking. This is useful if they want to guarantee a certain number of troops on the attacking territory after the engagementâ€”maybe to defend against a different adjacent territory.
* Under the hood, it uses dynamic programming, which is probably a bit cleaner than using matrix algebra (e.g., a direct implementation of [this paper](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~jaosborn/research/RISK.pdf)).

I've also included a function that helps you find the smallest number of troops that would guarantee a win probability that is *at least* some target probability. This is useful for deciding where to allocate troops at the beginning of a turn.

Code is written in Python 3.7.4.

### Battle outcomes

If you have 5 troops and you're attacking a territory with 3 troops:

territory | attack win probability
        1 | 0.6416228964559516
```

Let's add a few wrinkles:
* Instead of just one territory, you want to attack **three territories consecutively**, moving all your troops onto conquered territories along the way. The second territory has 2 troops, and the third has 1.
* The second of the three territories has a +2 defense bonus, meaning defense rolls with **8-sided dice** when defending that territory.

### Troop allocation

If you want to *find* the minimum number of attack troops that would guarantee victory with at least 0.95 probability in the above scenario, we could do the following:

```
>>> python3 min_troops.py 0.95 3 2 1 --dsides 6 8 6
17 troops gives a win probability of 0.953038445204023
```

With verbosity (`-v`), we can see the values tested:

```
>>> python3 min_troops.py 0.95 3 2 1 --dsides 6 8 6 -v
2019-08-19 00:12:27,077 - testing upper bound 8...
2019-08-19 00:12:27,129 - not high enough; trying range 9 to 16...
2019-08-19 00:12:27,130 - not high enough; trying range 17 to 32...
2019-08-19 00:12:27,134 - searching for number of troops...
2019-08-19 00:12:27,136 - 24 (within bounds 17 to 32) gives 0.9964873460982187
2019-08-19 00:12:27,139 - 20 (within bounds 17 to 23) gives 0.9840648899621028
2019-08-19 00:12:27,141 - 18 (within bounds 17 to 19) gives 0.9670287614740551
2019-08-19 00:12:27,143 - 17 (within bounds 17 to 17) gives 0.953038445204023
17 troops gives a win probability of 0.953038445204023
```


## Python

```python
>>> from risk import outcomes
>>> battle_probs = outcomes.calc_battle_probs(a=5, d=[3, 2, 1], d_sides=[6, 8, 6])
>>> battle_probs  # key is (territory, attack, defense)
{(1, 1, 2): 0.38715323159729165, (1, 1, 1): 0.09612780006053091, (2, 1, 1): 0.09326837465921452, (2, 2, 0): 0.03540994291874709, (2, 3, 0): 0.029663547220175827, (0, 1, 1): 0.08332453584748056, (0, 1, 3): 0.13115845129680434, (0, 1, 2): 0.1438941163997636}
>>> outcomes.calc_win_probs(battle_probs)  # indexed by territory
[0.64162289645596, 0.15834186479813744, 0.06507349013892291]
```

See function `outcomes.calc_cum_probs` for computing cumulative probabilities and `min_troops.find_min_troops` for (as you might guess) finding min troops, as described above. For a version of `outcomes.calc_battle_probs` that uses simulation to compute *approximate* probabilities, see `outcomes.simulate`.
